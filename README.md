  ## Description
  This project was assigned during the Ga Tech Full Stack Flex Development program. The aim of this project was to utilize node to create a script capable of creating an html file with information entered about a particular team displayed on said file. This app does just this, it will take in a single Team Manager and allow potentially infinite numbers of engineers and interns to be added, and creates an eye appealing html page with this entered information.
